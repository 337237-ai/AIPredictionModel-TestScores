Can a computer predict a test score using study time and sleep?
Project Title

Test Score Prediction Using Study Time and Sleep

Problem

This project explores whether a computer can predict a student’s test score based on how long they study and how much sleep they get. Understanding this relationship shows how data and machine learning can be used to make predictions in real-world situations like education and performance tracking.

Solution

I created a dataset containing hours studied, hours slept, and test scores. Using Python, I trained a simple machine learning model that learns patterns from this data. Once trained, the model predicts a test score when given new values for study time and sleep.

Tools

Python

pandas

scikit-learn

Linear Regression

Google Sheets

Results – Output

The model successfully generated predictions based on the input data.
Learning

This project helped me understand how machine learning models learn from data, how to train a model using Python, and how to organize and publish a complete AI project on GitHub.
